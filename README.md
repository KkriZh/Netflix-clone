# Netflix Clone

This is a basic front-end Netflix-style landing page built with HTML and CSS. I made it as a simple practice project to work on layout, sections, and styling.

## What’s inside
- Hero section with email input
- Feature sections with media blocks
- FAQ section
- Footer links

## Run it
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes
This is front-end only. No backend or real login is included.
